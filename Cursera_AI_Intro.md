# AI INTRODUCTION

## AI value
- Sectors of industry affecte by AI by 2030: Retail, Travel, Transport & Logistig, Automotive & Assembly, Basic Materials, Advanced Electronics / Semiconductors, Healthcare System & Services, High Tech, Telecom, Oil & Gas and Agriculture.
## Demystifying AI
- AI can be separated into:
  - ANI: Artificial Narrow Inteligence (Smart Sepaker, Self-driving car, web search, AI farming and factories)
  - AGI: Artificial General Inteligence (Do anything a human can do) Not developed.
## What is AI?
### Machine learning (ML)
- Supervised Learning: A to B mapping

- Aumount of data (X) vs. Performance: Amount of data has increase exponentially in the last years, and the performace would find a plateau that beyond a certain point would not be increase with the amount of data, but it will increase with the complexity of the neural net.

- So to performe at high level and drive bussines value you need Big Data and large computational neural networks.
### Data
- Data is very important to develope an application, it is up to the case or you to decide what are the inputs (A) or the outputs (B)
- Acquiring data:
  - Manual labeling (cat / not cat image)
  - From observing behaviors (user ID, time, price, buy? (y/n) or a machine recording data like T,P, failure?(y/n))
  - Down load from websites / partnerships
- Mis-use of data:
  - As soon you collect data start feeding it into your AI team and have feedback to improve the development
  - Don't throw data at an AI team and assume it will be valuable.
- Data is messy: Clean the data
  - Garbage in, garbage out
  - Data problems:
      - Incorrect labels (structured data)
      - Missing values (structured data)
      - Multiple types of data: Images, audio, text (unstructured data)
### AI terminology
- Machine learning vs. Data Science (DS): ML is a piece of software that outputs some kind of response and DS analyzes and extracts conclusions from ML to make decisions.
- ML: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- DS: Science of extracting knowledge and insights from data.
- Deep Learning = (Artificial) Neural Networks (ANN/NN): Takes several inputs (A) and combines them in steps (neurons) in order to obtain an output (B) and learns A to B in order to predict the output.

- AI has many tools: Unsupervised learning, reinformcement learning, graphical models, planning, knowledge graph...
### What makes an AI company?
- Rise of the Internet: A lesson from the rise of the internet is that a shopping mall with a website does not make an Internet company. An Internet company is a company that does the things that internet very well:
  - A/B testing
  - Short iteration time
  - Decision making pushed down to engineers and other specialized roles
- Rise of the AI: Any company + deep learning doesnt make a AI company. AI company are good a:
  - Strategic data adquisition (even if it does not provide wealth inmediatly)
  - Unified data warehouse (data in one place) subject to private garantees.
  - Pervasive automation
  - New roles (MLE Machine learnging Engineer) and division of labor
- AI Transformation for companies:
  1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum (small projects in/out house to understand what AI can do for you)
  2. Build an in-house AI team
  3. Provide broad AI training (not only to engineers but to supervisors, executives and liders)
  4. Develop an AI strategy
  5. Develop internal and externa communication (All interested teams, from employees to investors and clients ara informed of how the company is assimilating the AI growth).
### What ML (AI) can and cannot do
- CAN DO: Anything you can do with 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate.
  - Self driving car (A:Image, radar, lidar --> B: Position Cars around)
  - X-Ray diagnosis of pneumonia (A: Image labeled --> B: yes or no)
- CANNOT DO: Something complex
  - Analyze the market and write a 50 page report for example.
  - Self driving car: Interpret the intention of a human gesturing at your car (stop of police, bike turn signal) because there is not enough data and it needs high accuracy.
  - X-Ray diagnosis of neumonia: Diagnose pneumonia from 10 images of medical textbook chapter explaining pneumonia.
- Problems associated with very complex problems like write an automatic response to an email:
  - Not enought data as example to train the output
  - It can develope the same response for all cases
  - It can make a wrong sentence
- What makes a ML problem easier:
  - Learning a "simple" concept (something that takes some seconds for a humans)
  - Lots of data available
- Strenghts and weakneses of ML:
  - (+) Leaning a simple concept and there is a lot of data available
  - (-) Learning complex concepts from small amounts of data
  - (-) It is asked to perform on new types of data (the image is tilted or there are some inperfections for example)
### Non-technical explanation of DL
- Example on demand prediction: How to price the Tshirts based on demand (the higher the price the lower the demand)
  - A(price) --> () --> B(demand)
  - A neuron () would compute at to what point we can increase the price

  - Increasing complexity of the problem with more input variables (price, shiping cost, marketing, material)
  - One first step will be analyze the sentiment of the client (Affordability, awareness, percived quality) and take note that not all the inputs are going to all the sentiments in the second layer.
  - The ouput will be the demand

  - To make a NN you feed it with a lot of the data and deduce what is the appropiate layer of the sentiments to output the demand
