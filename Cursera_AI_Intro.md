# AI INTRODUCTION

## AI value
- Sectors of industry affecte by AI by 2030: Retail, Travel, Transport & Logistig, Automotive & Assembly, Basic Materials, Advanced Electronics / Semiconductors, Healthcare System & Services, High Tech, Telecom, Oil & Gas and Agriculture.
## Demystifying AI
- AI can be separated into:
  - ANI: Artificial Narrow Inteligence (Smart Sepaker, Self-driving car, web search, AI farming and factories)
  - AGI: Artificial General Inteligence (Do anything a human can do) Not developed.
## What is AI?
### Machine learning (ML)
- Supervised Learning: A to B mapping

- Aumount of data (X) vs. Performance: Amount of data has increase exponentially in the last years, and the performace would find a plateau that beyond a certain point would not be increase with the amount of data, but it will increase with the complexity of the neural net.

- So to performe at high level and drive bussines value you need Big Data and large computational neural networks.
### Data
- Data is very important to develope an application, it is up to the case or you to decide what are the inputs (A) or the outputs (B)
- Acquiring data:
  - Manual labeling (cat / not cat image)
  - From observing behaviors (user ID, time, price, buy? (y/n) or a machine recording data like T,P, failure?(y/n))
  - Down load from websites / partnerships
- Mis-use of data:
  - As soon you collect data start feeding it into your AI team and have feedback to improve the development
  - Don't throw data at an AI team and assume it will be valuable.
- Data is messy: Clean the data
  - Garbage in, garbage out
  - Data problems:
      - Incorrect labels (structured data)
      - Missing values (structured data)
      - Multiple types of data: Images, audio, text (unstructured data)
### AI terminology
- Machine learning vs. Data Science (DS): ML is a piece of software that outputs some kind of response and DS analyzes and extracts conclusions from ML to make decisions.
- ML: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- DS: Science of extracting knowledge and insights from data.
- Deep Learning = (Artificial) Neural Networks (ANN/NN): Takes several inputs (A) and combines them in steps (neurons) in order to obtain an output (B) and learns A to B in order to predict the output.

- AI has many tools: Unsupervised learning, reinformcement learning, graphical models, planning, knowledge graph...
### What makes an AI company?
